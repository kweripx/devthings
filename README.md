# üöÄ AstroWind

## Getting started

**AstroWind** tries to give you quick access to creating a website using [Astro](https://astro.build/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a free theme focuses on simplicity, good practices and high performance.

Very little vanilla javascript is used only to provide basic functionality so that each developer decides which framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid JS...) to use and how to approach their goals..

### Project structure

Inside AstroWind template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```

‚îÇ   |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [...categories]/
|   |   |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [category]/
|   |   |       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [...page].astro
‚îÇ   |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [...tags]/
|   |   |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [tag]/

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.mjs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.

Basic configuration file: `./src/config.mjs`

```javascript

  basePathname: '/', // Change this if you need to deploy to Github Pages, for example
  trailingSlash: false, // Generate permalinks with or without "/" at the end

  title: 'Example - This is the homepage title of Example',
  description: 'This is the homepage description of Example',

  googleAnalyticsId: false, // or "G-XXXXXXXXXX",
  googleSiteVerificationId: false, // or some value,
};

export const BLOG = {
  disabled: false,
  postsPerPage: 4,

  blog: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: 'blog', // blog main path, you can change this to "articles" (/articles)
  },

  post: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: '', // empty for /some-post, value for /pathname/some-post
  },

  category: {

- [ ] Create component or utilities for related posts.
- [ ] Add more _shortcodes_ or _embed_ functions to posts in Markdown: (eg Video, Tweet...).
- [ ] Add more Tailwind components useful for most scenarios (Features, Contact, Call to Actions, Content, FAQs...)
- [ ] Add commonly used example pages (Ex: About, Terms, Profile, Services...).
- [ ] Create detailed documentation with best practices and redesign tips.

### Advanced

- [ ] Create external library or place with useful Tailwind components.
- [ ] Create examples of AstroWind in CodeSanbox or a similar platform that can be easily synchronized with new updates. (Redesign, Integration with React or Svelte components, Use of Tailwind plugins, Connection to headless CMS ...).
